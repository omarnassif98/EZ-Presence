# EZ Presence

## Introduction

EZ Presence is a presence management platform that streamlines and speeds up the attendance process by enabling self-service attendance recording. It does this through the generation of a specialized QR code at the start of each class which can then be scanned by students; doing this records their attendance for the day. The teacher also has access to a dashboard where they can view statistics and perform other tasks, such as automatic email generation, to aid their attendance records.
